This repository contains the first small projects I have done in Python:
* Password generator - Whenever it's time to create a new password I run out of ideas what should be my new password. With password generator I have a helping hand in keeping my accounts safe. This password generator generates a password of any length given by the user of random characters which are stored in a file. The most challenging part of this project was using the tkinter module as it was the first time I experimented with it in Python to create an interface for the password generator. 
  
* Random recipe generator - When I thought about issues that take too much time away from my everyday life, then 2 came to find: what to wear next and what on Earth should I be cooking for next week. To solve the latter problem I created a random recipe generator, which helpes me choose a random reciple from the list of my most common recipes.
  
* Food items list modifier - When I created the random recipe generator I had an idea to also try to synthesize it with a list of food items I already have at home. For the first step in the project I created the list for food items where I can add and remove items in the list. The next step is to synthesize the list with random recipe generation. For now it's an ongoing process, but soon I'll be able to share some results!
