This repository contains the first small projects I have done in Python:
* Password generator - generates a password of any length given by the user of random characters which are stored in a file.
* Random recipe generator - chooses a random recipe from the list of recipes in a file.
* Food items list modifier - creates, modifies, deletes a list for food items.

The projects can be found on this site: https://github.com/madlik/First-Projects
