This repository contains the first small projects I have done in Python:

* Primitive desktop cleaner - If you're like me you probably have too many tabs opened on your web browser or too many files blocking the view of your desktop. To solve the latter issue I created a primitive desktop cleaner using the power of os and shutil modules. This cleaner is designed to move files from desktop to designated folders all at once (by file type or all files at once) saving you time when cleaning and organising your desktop. You can clean files by type, like Microsoft Office files, PDF-files, picture files, Python files or any other type of files you need to remove from your desktop. If you don't have a suitable folder to move the files into you can also create it with the cleaner. And why stop with your desktop? Clean the downloads folder or documents folder or any other folder which hasn't been organised for ages. Primitive desktop cleaner saves you valuable time you can use more important pursuits in life.

* Password generator - Whenever it's time to create a new password I run out of ideas what should be my new password. With password generator I have a helping hand in keeping my accounts safe. This password generator generates a password of any length given by the user of random characters which are stored in a file. The most challenging part of this project was using the tkinter module as it was the first time I experimented with it in Python to create an interface for the password generator. 
  
* Random recipe generator - When I thought about issues that take too much time away from my everyday life, then 2 came to find: what to wear next and what on Earth should I be cooking for next week. To solve the latter problem I created a random recipe generator, which helpes me choose a random reciple from the list of my most common recipes.
  
* Food items list modifier - When I created the random recipe generator I had an idea to also try to synthesize it with a list of food items I already have at home. For the first step in the project I created the list for food items where I can add and remove items in the list. The next step is to synthesize the list with random recipe generation. For now it's an ongoing process, but soon I'll be able to share some results!
